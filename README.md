# Movie Catalog

### Setup
  * Clone this repo
  * inside root directory: run ```bundle install```, ```rails db:setup```, and ```rails s```
  * inside ```/frontend```: run ```npm install```, ```npm start```, and then answer ```Y``` to the terminal prompt:

  ```
  ? Something is already running on port 3000. Probably:
  puma 3.11.3 (tcp://0.0.0.0:3000) [movie_catalog]   (pid #####)
  in /path/to/movie_catalog

  Would you like to run the app on another port instead? (Y/n)
  ```

  * this should launch ```localhost:3001``` in your browser
